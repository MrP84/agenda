# Agenda

## Summary

This project is made to build a personnalized agenda so that people, once they registered, can pick up a date, modufiy it and delete it. The owner of the agenda can manage al accounts

## Tech

This project is based on :

- React JS

In order to make it easier, I made a [gulpfile.js] (../gulpfile.babel.js) which compiles and transpiles code differently depending on dev mode or production mode. Gulp is the task runner, Webpack as a script bundler, minifier and uglifier.

## Todo

- send mail to owner
